# A story in DA3018

Once upon a time, by a lake called _Brunnsviken_, there was an old castle
made of red bricks. 

No one knows how old the castle was just like no one knows what the biggest ***prime number*** is...
Maybe it was just a coincidence and maybe it was not.Anyway...
A group of mathematicians gathered here in order to figure out what the biggest ***prime number*** is.
To find the biggest prime they first needed the biggest number. Some have heard that Chuck Norris found it twice.
